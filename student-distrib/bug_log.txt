CP3.1
1.  issue:
    - GDT does not work, boot loops
    fix:
    - had to comment out launch_tests() in kernal.c
2.  issue:
    - stuck in boot loop, this is because IDT is not working
    fix:
    - I was never actually initilizing my IDT in boot.S, just loading the register
3.  issue:
    - invalid magic number error, magic number is 0x004025F9, should be 0x2BADB002
    fix:
    - i forgot to preserve the caller saved registers, once I did that it worked
4.  issue:
    - my divide error/divide by 0 test causes the OS to boot loop
    fix:
    - i had the order of the reserved bits reveresed so my trap gate was not actually a trap gate
