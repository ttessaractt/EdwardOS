Description:
    hello fails after second iteration
Solution:
    data blocks had size of 40000 bytes instead of regular 
    block size of 4096 bytes. to fix, multiple functions had to be 
    edited and every time file_open is called, a char buffer
    of size cur_file_det.length has to be allocated because before 
    the implementation was causing other memory to be overwritten
