                        BUG 1                         
<--------------------------------------------------------->

Description:
    hello fails after second iteration
Solution:
    data blocks had size of 40000 bytes instead of regular 
    block size of 4096 bytes. to fix, multiple functions had to be 
    edited and every time file_open is called, a char buffer
    of size cur_file_det.length has to be allocated because before 
    the implementation was causing other memory to be overwritten

    page fault when running sigtest

    I accidently broke parse arguments trying to fix getargs when the only issue was there was there was no
    input for argument

                          BUG 5                          
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Time:
    2024.4.13.

Description:
    in 2nd shell cant run files, get error and then it also halts 2nd shell
    in 2nd shell:
        testprint - page fault after halt (then close 2nd shell & terminated by exception)
        hello - invalid opcode exception after halt (then close 2nd shell & terminated by exception)
        ls - page fault
        syserr (0) - closes syserr, then prints garbage followed by err_big_fd: FAIL and then page fault (then close 2nd shell & terminated by exception)
Solution:
    we fully misunderstood what we were doing and turns out we should not be able to run programs from the 2nd
    shell. we fixed our code to not just be for input shell and it works

                          BUG 7                          
<--------------------------------------------------------->
Time:
    2024.4.14.
Creator:
    Tessa Samuels.
Description:
    testing cat on frame0.txt & frame0.txt prints the 1st line and then prints garbage 
    and then page faults. other non text files also page fault. 
    the single line being printed is due to returning when new line is encountered, still does not print full file before printing garbage
Solution:
    our terminal only supported 128, not 1024

Description:
    grep didnt close 
Solution:
    we were passing in a single file descriptor but were indexing it again as if it was an array
    due to old code

    Extend the maximum length of terminal write to 1024
    instead of 128 like it was for checkpoint 2.

Creator:

Description:
    Would not exit the while loop when reading data. Supposed
    to exit when you reach the end of the file.
Solution:
    Added an if statement checking if location is going to 
    be greater than the actual file length, and exit if so.

Creator:

Description:

    1 to make this memory page accessible to the user which points
    to video memory

                        BUG 14

Description:
    Program loader buffer being passed in was overwriting PCB
Solution:
    Instead of passing in an instantiated character buffer,
    directly fed in the address for the program image into program
    loader so PCB values are not overwritten
