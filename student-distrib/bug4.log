Description:
    hello fails after second iteration
Solution:
    data blocks had size of 40000 bytes instead of regular 
    block size of 4096 bytes. to fix, multiple functions had to be 
    edited and every time file_open is called, a char buffer
    of size cur_file_det.length has to be allocated because before 
    the implementation was causing other memory to be overwritten

Description:
    in 2nd shell cant run files, get error and then it also halts 2nd shell
    in 2nd shell:
        testprint - page fault after halt (then close 2nd shell & terminated by exception)
        hello - invalid opcode exception after halt (then close 2nd shell & terminated by exception)
        ls - page fault
        syserr (0) - closes syserr, then prints garbage followed by err_big_fd: FAIL and then page fault (then close 2nd shell & terminated by exception)
Solution:
    we fully misunderstood what we were doing and turns out we should not be able to run programs from the 2nd
    shell. we fixed our code to not just be for input shell and it works
