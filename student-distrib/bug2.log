Description:
    Pressing caps lock wouldn't show uppercase letters despite
    use of a caps lock check variable.
Solution:
    Caps lock check variable has to be defined globally in the
    keyboard.h file instead of inside keyboard_handler.

Description:
    Keyboard handler would print keys twice.
Solution:
    When moving the printf statement outsid of the ifs
    it was originally in, caused it to print twice
    since the keyboard sends two interrupts, once when
    key is pressed and once when key let go.
    So used a good_index flag to make sure it only
    printed when the key was pressed.

Description:
    In order for backspace to work, need to hit backspace once
    before it actually does anything.

    Decrement screen x before clearing vid memory since putc
    increments screen x after writing to vid memory.

Description:
    my set freqency function does not change the frequency, 
    after a bit of testing it seems like the freqency is not 
    saved when the rtc handler is called
Solution:
    I was never actually getting the previous value of 
    register A so the top bits of the register were 
    constantly being cleared

    my logic to get the rate in set freqency doesn't work to set 
    frequency to 2
Solution:
    my starting value was 0x10 and it had to be changed to 
    0x01, edge case

Description:
    only 1 1 prints for rtc test, looks like a 2nd interrupt

    correctly

Creator:

Description:
    Issues accessing members of structs
Solution:
    Instead of using a '.' had to use '->' since the struct
    is a pointer

Description:
    Was printing incorrect file_name, file_type, and file_sizes
